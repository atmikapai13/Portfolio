## Projects
### Analysis of Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Ridership and Distance-Based Fare Model

**1. A Journey Through BART Ridership Trends**
[_(Link)_](https://medium.com/@atmikapai/a-journey-through-bart-ridership-trends-5cfdd0819c0c)

Dissected BART Ridership data from 1998 to Sep 2023, identified most popular stations pre and post-pandemic, and evaluated post-pandemic ridership recovery across counties using **Python**

**2. BART’s Distance-Based Fare Model: Price and Income Elasticity of Demand** [_(Link)_](https://medium.com/@atmikapai/understanding-barts-distance-based-fare-model-d78751ca8454)

Evaluated Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) for BART transit by exploiting natural experiment of 50% BART fare discount in Sep 2022; identified entry/exit routes with PED > 1 and formulated price reductions to engage ridership for those routes.

Deterimined Income Elasticity of Demand for BART transit across counties and established nature and perception of transit service across Bay Area counties. Analysis was conducted in **Python** .

**3. Forecasting BART's Ridership Trends using SARIMA and Prophet** [_(Link)_](https://medium.com/@atmikapai/forecasting-bart-ridership-sarmix-vs-prophet-8fdfae5f24bc)

Evaluated model performance on train and test set using Seasonal Autoregression Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and Prophet regression models in **Python** and forecasted BART monthly weekday ridership till 2027   

### Impact of OPT-STEM Migration [_(Link)_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/118bfGKnELZRF4oGHpZtPU3rMLqZk8e_d/view)

Independently researched and authored paper on the impacts of selective migration policy on student migration and patenting in the US by employing difference-in-difference methodology in **STATA** and **R**.

### Cool Climate Networks [_(Link)_](https://coolclimate.berkeley.edu/)

Created dashboards on transportation and climate change for climate action portal, EcoDataLab, using **Python** for data synthesis and **Tableau** for data visualizations.

###  Version-Control System [_(Link)_](https://github.com/atmikapai13/CS61BL-Data-Structures/tree/main/Proj2%20-%20Gitlet)
Implementing a version-control system, mimicking basic features of the popular system Git, in **Java** as part of CS61B: Data Structures coursework. Features supported by my version-control system: 
- Saving the contents of entire directories of files, similar to comitting contents/commits
- Restoring a version of one or more files or entire commits
- Viewing the history of your backups
- Maintaining related sequences of commits, called branches.
- Merging changes made in one branch into another.

### Recreating 2048 Game [_(Link)_](https://github.com/atmikapai13/CS61BL-Data-Structures/tree/main/Proj0%20-%20Recreating%202048)

Recreated 2048 game, a single-player computer game originally designed by Gabriele Cirulli in **Java** as part of CS61B: Data Structures coursework
