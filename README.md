## Projects

### Analysis of Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Ridership and Distance-Based Fare Model

**1. A Journey Through BART Ridership Trends**
[_(Link)_](https://medium.com/@atmikapai/a-journey-through-bart-ridership-trends-5cfdd0819c0c)

Dissected BART Ridership data from 1998 to Sep 2023, identified most popular stations pre and post-pandemic, and evaluated post-pandemic ridership recovery across counties using **Python**

**2. BART’s Distance-Based Fare Model: Price and Income Elasticity of Demand** [_(Link)_](https://medium.com/@atmikapai/understanding-barts-distance-based-fare-model-d78751ca8454)

Evaluated Price Elasticity of Demand (PED) for BART transit by exploiting natural experiment of 50% BART fare discount in Sep 2022; identified entry/exit routes with PED > 1 and formulated price reductions to engage ridership for those routes.

Deterimined Income Elasticity of Demand for BART transit across counties and established nature and perception of transit service across Bay Area counties. Analysis was conducted in **Python** .

**3. Forecasting BART's Ridership Trends using SARIMA and Prophet** [_(Link)_](https://medium.com/@atmikapai/forecasting-bart-ridership-sarmix-vs-prophet-8fdfae5f24bc)

Evaluated model performance on train and test set using Seasonal Autoregression Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) and Prophet regression models in **Python** and forecasted BART monthly weekday ridership till 2027   

**4. SQL Database of BART ridership and GTFS datat** [_(Link)_](https://medium.com/@atmikapai/sql-database-for-bart-ridership-and-scheduling-data-8fadb40efc51)

Created novel database on BART ridership from 2001 to 2023 and General Specification Transit Feed (GTFS) scheduling data for urban data enthusiasts to be able to conduct temporal and geospatial analysis from one database

### Impact of OPT-STEM Migration [_(Link)_](https://drive.google.com/file/d/118bfGKnELZRF4oGHpZtPU3rMLqZk8e_d/view)
